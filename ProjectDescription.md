# Challenge 2: Hulpwijzer — Benefits Navigator for Single Parents

Partner Organization: Stichting Single SuperMom
Sponsored by ActivePieces.com — €250 Best Hulpwijzer Fix Prize

Point of Contact: Tijs — Feel free to reach out with any questions about this case!

The Problem: Money Doesn't Reach the People Who Need It

Stichting Single SuperMom is the largest network of single parents in the Netherlands, founded in 2008. The organization supports approximately 500,000 single parents and has the support of Queen Máxima. Their mission is to strengthen the socio-economic position and well-being of single parents through support programs and advocacy.

Key Insight: Single parents belong to one of the poorest and most socially isolated groups in the Netherlands. Approximately half of all single parents live in poverty or struggle to make ends meet.

The Scale of the Problem

Single Parents in the Netherlands (2023):
• 492,300 single mothers
• 118,300 single fathers
• Numbers increasing every year

Poverty Statistics:
• ~50% of single parents live in poverty or struggle financially
• 540,000 people total living in poverty in 2023 (3.1% of population)
• 115,000+ children under 18 growing up in poverty
• 272,000–315,000 children growing up at subsistence level

The Core Problem: Non-Take-Up of Benefits ("Potjes")

The biggest issue isn't that benefits don't exist — it's that people can't find them or access them.

Non-Take-Up Crisis:
• 35% of entitled households don't claim minimum income benefit (bijstand)
• ~50% of low-income families don't use social subsidies for their children
• Once families use one fund, the threshold for applying to others becomes lower — but most never take that first step

Why People Don't Apply:
• They don't know what benefits ("potjes") exist
• They don't know if they qualify
• They don't understand the application processes
• They don't have time to research and apply
• They fear making mistakes and facing consequences
• They deeply distrust government systems (see: Toeslagenaffaire)
• They feel shame about asking for help
• They worry money will need to be repaid

The Bureaucracy Problem

The Netherlands has ~342 municipalities, and each develops its own poverty policies with different:
• Income thresholds (120% vs 150% of social minimum)
• Eligibility criteria
• Application processes
• Available schemes

A 2024 Nibud study found that people in similar circumstances receive vastly different support depending on which municipality they live in: "In one municipality you did not receive an energy allowance if your income was 130% of the minimum, in the other municipality you did. Just explain that."

This fragmentation means:
• No central overview of available benefits
• Confusing eligibility rules that vary by location
• Multiple separate applications required
• Different deadlines and renewal processes
• Information scattered across dozens of websites

The Toeslagenaffaire: Why Trust is Broken

What Happened (2005–2019):
The Dutch Tax and Customs Administration (Belastingdienst) used algorithms to create "risk profiles" for childcare benefit fraud. The system flagged families based on:
• Dual nationality (used as fraud indicator)
• "Foreign-sounding" names
• Low income
• Minor errors in paperwork

The Consequences:
• 26,000–35,000 families wrongly accused of fraud
• Families ordered to repay tens of thousands of euros in benefits
• Many pushed into severe poverty, unable to pay for food and heating
• Forced evictions, job losses, divorces
• Over 2,000 children taken into foster care
• Multiple suicides among affected parents
• Single parents and families from minority backgrounds disproportionately targeted

Government Response:
• January 2021: The Rutte III cabinet resigned over the scandal
• May 2022: Government admitted "institutional racism" was a root cause
• Most families still haven't received proper compensation

Design Implication: Any solution must assume the user has been personally burned by "the system" or knows someone who has. The interface should NOT feel governmental. Data handling must be transparent and user-controlled.

The Benefits Landscape

National Schemes (Toeslagen):
| Benefit | Purpose | Administrator |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Kinderbijslag | Child benefit (per child, quarterly) | SVB |
| Kindgebonden budget | Child-related budget (income-tested) | Belastingdienst |
| Kinderopvangtoeslag | Childcare benefit | Belastingdienst |
| Zorgtoeslag | Healthcare allowance | Belastingdienst |
| Huurtoeslag | Rent benefit | Belastingdienst |
| ALO-kop | Single parent supplement | Belastingdienst |

Municipal Schemes (vary by municipality):
| Scheme | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Bijzondere bijstand | Special assistance for unexpected costs |
| Individuele inkomenstoeslag | Individual income supplement |
| Kwijtschelding gemeentelijke belastingen | Municipal tax remission |
| Minimaregelingen | Various minimum income schemes |
| School cost subsidies | Help with education expenses |
| Stadspassen | City passes for discounted activities |

Private Funds:
| Fund | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Stichting Leergeld | School supplies, sports fees, laptops |
| Stichting Jarige Job | Birthday boxes for children (worth €35) |
| Jeugdfonds Sport & Cultuur | Sports and cultural activities |
| Nationaal Fonds Kinderhulp | General children's welfare |

Note: These four organizations have formed Sam& voor alle kinderen ("Together for all children"), providing a single portal for applications. This is a good model — but only covers four funds, and awareness is low.

User Personas

Primary User: The Overwhelmed Single Parent
Working part-time or irregular hours, single-handedly managing household, childcare, and work. Stretched thin on time and energy.

Their situation:
• Income around or below poverty line (~€1,510/month for single person, ~€2,535 for family with two children)
• Struggling to cover basics: rent, energy, healthcare, childcare
• Missing out on support for children: sports, culture, school supplies, birthdays

Their challenges:
• Not knowing what benefits exist
• Not knowing if they qualify
• Not understanding application processes
• Not having time to research and apply
• Fear of making mistakes and facing consequences
• Deep distrust of government systems
• Shame about asking for help
• Worry that money will need to be repaid

Secondary User: Case Workers
Municipal employees, NGO staff, or volunteers who help families navigate the system.

Their pain points:
• Cannot see the full picture of a family's situation across fragmented systems
• Spend time on paperwork instead of actual support
• Different systems don't communicate
• Hard to track what's been applied for vs. received

The Challenge

Build a "Hulpwijzer" (Benefits Navigator) that helps single parents:

1. Discover what "potjes" (funds/benefits) they might be eligible for
2. Understand the requirements in plain language
3. Navigate the application process with confidence
4. Feel safe and in control of their data

Key considerations:
• Must feel trustworthy and non-governmental
• Must handle the complexity of 342 different municipal policies
• Must be accessible to users with low digital literacy
• Must respect the trauma and distrust created by the Toeslagenaffaire
